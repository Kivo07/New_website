        Hello, my name is Nathan Karabulut! I am a high school student living in Ontario and I have decided to
    build this website to document my life throughout high school. On this site you will find my software
projects, my travel videos and many more! My hobbies include: programming, flying drones, Muay Thai and
playing guitar! I have also started this website as a software project and will be adding new features as 
I learn new things!</article>
